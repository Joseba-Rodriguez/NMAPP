# NMAPP (Network Mapping Application)

NMAPP (Network Mapping Application) is a tool designed to perform network scans and monitor the presence of hosts and services in a given network. It provides a web interface that allows users to conduct scans, visualize the results, and efficiently manage the obtained information.

NMAPP utilizes the Nmap tool to perform network scans and presents the results in a clear and organized manner. Users can access the web interface, log in, schedule scans, analyze the obtained results, download detailed reports, and manage their account.

The tool facilitates the detection of changes in the network, the discovery of new hosts, the identification of services and vulnerabilities, and the tracking of network infrastructure evolution.

Explore NMAPP and take advantage of its functionality to obtain detailed and up-to-date information about your network! Access the /NMAPP v2.0 folder for installation instructions.
